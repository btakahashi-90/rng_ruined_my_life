# RNG Ruined My Life

**RNG Ruined My Life** is a free, transparent RNG simulator that exposes the absurdity, streaks, and emotional whiplash of randomized systems. Designed as both a tool and a satire, it gives players a front-row seat to the mechanics that haunt their favorite games â€” complete with mass roll simulations, Z-scores, pity modifiers, anomaly detection, and visual feedback that makes you question everything.

This isnâ€™t a game you win â€” itâ€™s one you *understand*. And maybe yell at.
