An RNG simulator. A cathartic shrine to suffering.
Click buttons. Watch numbers betray you. Feel validated.

[b]Why does it exist?[/b]
To expose just how cursed your luck really is—with data, not just vibes.
Also: because I thought it’d be funny.

[b]Core Concepts:[/b]

Every roll is tracked.

TODO: Failure increases your success odds (pity scaling). Customizable.

Anomalies? They’re real, and they’re watching.

There is no winning. There is only rolling.

[b]Terms Glossary:[/b]

Z-score: Statistical measure of how far a result strays from average.

Anomaly: A run of improbability too bold to ignore.

Blast Cap: Max number of rolls per batch (safety first).

Merp Mode: Randomized passive rolling. It's fine. Probably. When its implemented...
